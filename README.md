Enjoy with the beauty of the Fractals

Introduction
The term fractal was first used by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1974. He based
it on the Latin word fractus which means "broken" or "fractured".
A fractal is an abstract mathematical object, such as a curve or a surface, whose
pattern remains consistent at every scale.
Various natural phenomena, such as the Romanesco cabbage, exhibit fractal features
